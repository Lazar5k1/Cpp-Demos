---LIST OF VOCAB WORDS FOR PROGRAMMING---

Explicit - Done by the programmer i.e. written code

Implicit - Done by the program or tool i.e. inherent features of a program or language like classes and data types

static_cast<desired data type>(source) - there's shorthand for this but for now just use it to change data types i.e. static_cast<int>(3.5) == 3
